Welcome to my Github page!

I'm a Mathematics (BSc) undergraduate from Newcastle University & Mathematical Sciences (MSc) postgraduate from Durham University. I mainly focus on Data analysis, Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics.

Here you can find my personal projects based on subjects of academic and personal interest, all of which are written in either Python, Cython or C++.
