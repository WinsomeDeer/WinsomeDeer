Welcome to my Github page.

I'm a Mathematics undergraduate & postgraduate from Newcastle University and Durham University. I mainly focus on Data analysis, Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics.

Here you can find my personal projects based on subjects of academic and personal interest, all of which are written in either Python or C++.
